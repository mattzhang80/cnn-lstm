Deep Learning Model for Visual Reasoning | Python, PyTorch, CUDA 

• Processed data into train, test, and validation sets using the CLEVR dataset (70k images and 700k questions).

• Built a CNN model with 4 layers (convolutions, batch norm, ReLU, and LSTM), enhancing feature analysis.

• Trained model for 40 epochs using Adam optimizer, charting train/validation loss/accuracy to track performance.

• Implemented a transformer architecture using PyTorch to further boost model performance to 47 per
